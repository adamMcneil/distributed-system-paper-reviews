# A Fault-Tolerant Million Qubit-Scale Distributed Quantum Computer
## Summary
ESM - error syndrome measurement
EDU - error decoding unit

A Quantum computer is a collection of computers.
These separate computers are stored in dilution refrigerators.
This paper describes how a team of students at Seoul National Univerisity designed and made a fault-tolerant million qubit-scale quantum computer.

Qubits are prone to error as shown in the previous research.
This paper applies an error correction method to million quantum bit computers.
The size of the current quantum computers is limited by the cooling of the system.
One of the techniques used for cooling is a distributed setting which allows you to utilize multiple dilution refrigerators.
The main problem with this approach is that it is error-prone.
I thought that the major drawbacks would be communication between the different refrigerators and the latency incurred.
This paper is about reducing those errors and the latency between refrigerators.

They list their three main novel contributions as:
- designing an ESM to work with multi-DR QCs
- designing an EDU to work in a distributed setting
- They also think that they have created the largest most efficient distributed quantum computer thus far.

The inrtoducting and related work are the most applicable secting in this paper for me because I have not research the are of quantum computing at all.


## Pros
- Truly does propose a novel application that is pushing the state of the art forward.

## Cons
- the paper seems incremental in nature but does make meaningful additions to the field that are worth reporting.

## Further Developments
There is a lot of further research to reduce the latency of working in a distributed setting.

## Other Comments
They use the phrase quantum supremacy I am not sure what they mean by this but sounds important.
What is a qubit?
Qubit stands for a quantum bit.
It is the quantum equivalent of a binary bit in traditional computing.

What is a dilution refrigerator?
They have applications outside of quantum computing, but they are used to literally keep stuff cold.

Million does not seem very large on the quantum scale, but I guess that is where the state of the art is right now.
We certainly have traditional computers that have more than a million bits.
