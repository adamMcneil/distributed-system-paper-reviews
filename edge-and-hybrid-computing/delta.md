# Delta: A Cloud-assisted Data Enrichment Framework for On-Device Continual Learning
## Summary
This is edge computing because they perform the computation on a mobile device instead of a central server.
The phone is the edge of the network.
- Cloud-assisted: modern solutions seem to rely fully on the cloud or not at all on the cloud. 
This offers a hybrid approach.
- Data Enrichment Framework: needs to be private, effective, and efficient.
It is the process of adding to data to get better results.
-On-Device Continuous Learning is the idea that an AI will learn the behavior of a specific user.
They do this by training on a specific person's data that they collect by interacting with various technologies.

One of the particular challenges is to train a model on a dynamic data set.
Since data is constantly being collected and changed, mechanisms need to be developed to determine how relevant the old data is compared to the new data.
They identify scarce data to be a "pervasive issue".
I do not really understand what this means.
It seems to me that people do not use their phones enough to build a model to predict behavior.
This does not seem like a problem to me though.

Few shot CL is trained on pervious collected data and then pushed that to personal devices to create a new model.
Federated CL is the idea of combining models that have been trained on specific devices to get a better understanding of the data.

They are running the model on a mobile device. 

## Pros
- The background gave a good introduction to CL.

## Cons
- Do we want to have an AI model trained on all of our personal data.
- I wish they had explained more thoroughly what data enrichment is.

## Further Developments
There do seem to be a lot of benefits of running computations like this on the edge of the network.
I would be interested in a paper that analyzed the performance of such models on mobile devices.

## Other Comments
This seems like one of the worst papers we have read thus far.
It seemed to be very repetitive and did not solve any real problems.
