# Stable Hierarchical Routing for Operational LEO Networks
## Summary
SHORT Stable Hierarchical Orbital Routing Technique
Short is a method of getting a stable hierarchy over a dynmanic network specifically with LEO (low earth orbite) satellites.
Obviously the network on the earth are not moving but the satellites that they are talking to are moving.
This paper is concerned with how to create a stable routing despite the dynamic nature of the satellites.

There is a certian level of unavoidable chun that comes with using applications like this.


## Pros
- SHORT saves 9–31,816 X routing table updates and 3–31,908 X global route control costs.
They claim to have some very large speed ups.

## Cons

## Further Developments

## Other Comments
How do they test and deploy their program?
