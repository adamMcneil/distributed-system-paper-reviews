# Building AI Agents for Autonomous Clouds: Challenges and Design Principles
## Summary
An AI agent is something like an AI that would help a developer write code in an IDE.
This paper aims to provide an agent like that but for IT operations.
Specifically to find fault localization and root cause analysis.
There are problems that one would encounter while trying to make such an agent this paper addresses those problems and lays the framework for solving them.
IT is the process of maintaining the system that delivers and maintains software.
Keeping these systems up is a matter of a lot of profit.
The overall goal of the paper is to make an autonomous cloud with AI a major part would be identifying errors.

Four step process for fault lifetime:
1. Dection: self explanatory
2. Triaging: Notifying real people to deal with the problem.
3. Diagnosis: understanding what the problem is.
4. Mitigation: trying to fix the problem.

Requirements and Principles
1. Modular design of the application.
2. Flexible interface that can be used by a human, computer, or AI.
3. Being able to operate at different scales.
4. Reproducible
5. Able to be used with different operating systems.
6. It should be able to handle errors at any part of the application stack.
7. Handling different loads.
8. Coverage of the operation lifecycle (I did not really understand this point)
9. The user should be able to see what is going on.
10. The agent should have the ability to change files

## Pros
- The paper is short to the point and easy to follow.

## Cons
- the results of the paper seem to be theoretical and there is not a tangible deliverable.
- They are a very far way away from the title of their paper of having autonomous AI agents for the cloud.
- It seems to me that a single well-made figure would be able to explain a lot of their paper.

## Further Developments
Obviously, a lot of work can be done here.
I think a personal agent that lived in your terminal would be cool.

## Other Comments
I am shocked that a paper like this can be published.
It does not seem like it explores any new ideas.

I would be interested in learning more about the fault generator part of the paper.
This seems like a particularly trick thing to implement.
